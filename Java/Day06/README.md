Day 6: Friday, 11th July 2025 - 6:48 PM

As of today, I will start practicing various of programming fundamental, including:

- Java OOP and Design
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- File I/O
- Cryptography (Hashing)

This project is a creation of "Medical Record Systems" using in hospital
to store patient's information. This is just a basic of the program so there
will be only 2 main functions:

1. Old Patient (retrieve patients' info by entering their ID)
2. New Patient (Register new patient's info, generating them a new HN code)

This project would benefit in understanding designing process and security of the system
infrastructure. Of course the information must always be sorted.


I will keep logging the process throughout the project!
