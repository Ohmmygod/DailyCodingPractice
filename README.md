# DailyCodingPractice
My personal coding area. 
Including basic Java and Python exercises.

I have pushed README.md, which is located at DailyCodingPractice/Java/Day06_Project_MedRec/README.md
But it accidentally removed everything after I committed that push.
Therefore, it's the first time I used 'git revert' to revert the previous commit
to restore every files.
Hence, all commit messages will be the same and show the same time logged for every file.
